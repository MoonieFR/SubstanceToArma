## SubstanceToArma

These presets were created to export and adapt textures from Substance Painter to Arma 3.

## List of presets 

- Arma 3 Super (MetRough) - Preset to export CO/NOHQ/AS/SMDI maps from a pbr metallic roughness project.
- Arma 3 Super (SpecGloss) - Preset to export CO/NOHQ/AS/SMDI maps from a non-pbr specular glossiness project.
- Arma 3 SuperAlpha (MetRough) - Preset to export CA/NOHQ/AS/SMDI maps including alpha information from a pbr metallic roughness project.
- Arma 3 SuperAlpha (SpecGloss) - Preset to export CA/NOHQ/AS/SMDI maps including Alpha information from a non-pbr specular glossiness project.
- Arma 3 SuperNo2Diff (MetRough) - Preset to export CO/NOHQ/AS/SMDI (O Grey OpenGL normal) maps from a pbr metallic roughness project.

Don't pay attention to the following warning: "'User1' channel is missing in your texture set."

## About SuperNo2Diff 
I use this preset when I want to include the normal map info into the diffuse, it's usefull in arma since it fakes depth even if there is no indirect light.
