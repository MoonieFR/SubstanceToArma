# ðŸŽ¨ Arma 3/DayZ Substance Painter Export Presets

Welcome to this collection of **Substance Painter presets** crafted to adapt your textures for **Arma 3** and **DayZ**! 

---

## âœ¨ Preset Overview

### Arma 3 Super

This preset uses the **metallic-roughness workflow**, configuring the SMDI (**specular map**) with the following channel setup:

- ðŸŸ¥ **Red**: `User1` (White)
- ðŸŸ© **Green**: Metallic
- ðŸŸ¦ **Blue**: Roughness

It will export the following maps:
  - `$TextureSet_CO` (Color map)
  - `$TextureSet_CA` (Color Map with Alpha)
  - `$TextureSet_SMDI` (Specular map)
  - `$TextureSet_NOHQ` (Normal map)

> **Note:** This preset is straightforward and works seamlessly for both Arma 3 and DayZ.  
> **Tip:** Ignore the warning "`User1` channel is missing in your texture set"` for this preset.

### Other Presets


In the "OTHERS" folder, you will find other export-presets including one preset for people working with SpecGloss instead of MetRough. 

---

#### Arma 3 Super (SpecGloss)

This preset supports the **specular-glossiness workflow**, optimized for **non-PBR projects** in Arma 3. Ideal for older workflows or specific texturing requirements.

---

#### Arma 3 SuperNo2Diff (MetRough)

This preset exports CO/NOHQ/AS/SMDI maps along with **Grey OpenGL normal maps** from a **metallic-roughness project**.  
It also embeds normal details directly into the diffuse/albedo map, adding depth even without indirect lighting.

## Workflow Tips

### Invert Roughness for Accurate Exports

If your texture appears too bright in-game, it may be necessary to **invert the roughness** before exporting from Substance Painter. 

To make this process easier, use the included **Smart Material**:  

#### `Arma 3 - MetRough.spsm`

This Smart Material, located in the **SmartMaterial** folder, can automate roughness inversion for you.

##### Steps to Use:

1. Drag and drop the **`Arma 3 - MetRough` Smart Material** into your **Layers Window**.
2. Move all your layers into the **`Arma 3 - MetRough` folder** created by the Smart Material.

This setup ensures that roughness inversion is handled correctly for Arma 3 and DayZ.

### Add Depth with the AO Layer

The included Smart Material also contains an **`AO` layer**, designed to add **fake shadows** based on your Ambient Occlusion (AO) map. Properly adjusted, it enhances the depth and realism of your textures.


##### How to Use the AO Layer:

1. Ensure the **`AO` layer** is positioned **above all other layers** in your stack.
2. Adjust opacity and blending modes for the AO layer to achieve your desired effect.

> **Tip:** Experiment with settings to see how the AO layer can breathe life into your textures!

### Specular Power Recommendations

For optimal results, set the `specularPower` value below 60 but ti's really up to you to try and find the correct one.
This ensures better control over shine and reflection. Adjust both **specular** and **specularPower** as needed for a balanced result.
