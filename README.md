## substance-arma

This preset has been created to export and adapt textures from substance painter to Arma 3 more easily.

It is meant to be used with a MetRough template. 

You can remove the "no2diff" file if you don't need it. I use this file to include the normal map info into the albedo, it's usefull in arma since it fakes depth even if there is no indirect light. 

Export preset: Arma 3

How to import :
1 - Clone this repository and copy the following file: *Arma 3.spexp*
2 - Go to the Substance Painter shelf located in your Documents.
    Windows: C:\Users\*username*\Documents\Substance Painter\shelf\export-presets
    Mac OS: Macintosh > Users > *username* > Documents > Substance Painter > shelf > export-presets
3 - Paste "*Arma 3.spexp*".
