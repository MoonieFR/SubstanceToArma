## substance-arma

This preset has been created to export and adapt textures from substance painter to Arma 3 more easily.

It is meant to be used with a MetRough template. 

You can remove the "no2diff" file if you don't need it. I use this file to include the normal map info into the albedo, it's usefull in arma since it fakes depth even if there is no indirect light. 

Export preset: Arma 3
