## SubstanceToArma

These presets were created to export and adapt textures from Substance Painter to Arma 3.

## List of presets 

- Arma 3 Super (MetRough) - Preset to export CO/NOHQ/AS/SMDI maps from a pbr metallic roughness project.
- Arma 3 Super (SpecGloss) - Preset to export CO/NOHQ/AS/SMDI maps from a non-pbr specular glossiness project.
- Arma 3 SuperAlpha (MetRough) - Preset to export CA/NOHQ/AS/SMDI maps including alpha information from a pbr metallic roughness project.
- Arma 3 SuperAlpha (SpecGloss) - Preset to export CA/NOHQ/AS/SMDI maps including Alpha information from a non-pbr specular glossiness project.
- Arma 3 SuperNo2Diff (MetRough) - Preset to export CO/NOHQ/AS/SMDI (+ Grey OpenGL normal) maps from a pbr metallic roughness project.

Don't pay attention to the following warning: "'User1' channel is missing in your texture set."

## About SuperNo2Diff 
I use this preset when I want to include my normal info into the diffuse/albedo/colormap. Including this information is convenient because it allows you to give an illusion of depth even without indirect light.
You can also do that directly in Substance Painter but it's more tricky.
